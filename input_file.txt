hey 
ask "what is your name?"
tell "My name is Adeen"

@sum=0;
loop( i=0; i<5;i++)
 @sum = @sum+1; 
 done

whole num = -3;      
pointy temperature = 23.5;  

if (num > 0) then
    "The number is positive";
otherwise
    "The number is negative";

ask "Your age?" -> 21;
word 7abc;



if (num < 0 &&& temperature < 0);
    "Both the number and temperature are negative" ;
then (num > 0 || temperature > 0);
    "At least one of the number or temperature is positive" ;
otherwise
    "Neither the number nor the temperature is positive" -> " ";

whole n = 5;               
whole result = 1;           
whole i = 1;               

tell "Starting factorial calculation for n;
n = 5;

loop (i <= n);
    result = result * i;
    i = i + 1;              
tell "Factorial result" -> result;

bye
