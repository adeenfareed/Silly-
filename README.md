**Silly++** is a fun little language made to feel like you’re talking to your computer.
You can say things like hey, ask, tell, or bye, and the program understands what you mean.
It’s designed to help you learn how compilers read and break down code into tokens.

**Why Silly++?**

Because programming doesn’t always have to be serious!
Silly++ is meant to make learning compilers light, funny, and creative while still showing how real code gets processed.
